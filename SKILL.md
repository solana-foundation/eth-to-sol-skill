# eth-to-sol

Translate Ethereum/Solidity contracts to production-grade Solana programs. The goal is not a 1:1 port — it is Solana-native code plus a teaching artifact that makes every decision legible to a developer who knows Solidity well and Solana barely.

## Two-pass protocol (hard rule)

Every translation produces two outputs in sequence. Do not collapse them.

1. **Pass 1 — Faithful port.** A semantically identical Anchor program. No restructuring, no SPL CPI substitutions, no parallelism rework. It exists so the refactor's value is legible. Mark obviously un-Solana patterns with `// SMELL:` comments rather than fixing them.
2. **Pass 2 — Solana-native refactor.** Restructured for Solana primitives: SPL programs via CPI, per-entity PDAs, parallelism-friendly account layout, explicit rent/sizing, compute-budget awareness, program splitting where warranted. Production-ready.

If a contract is trivially served by an existing Solana program (e.g. a vanilla ERC-20), the optimized version will be drastically smaller than the naive port. That is the lesson.

## Output contract

For an input named `foo`, produce exactly these artifacts:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `01-original.<ext>` | The input (Solidity, Vyper, etc.). Already present; do not rewrite. |
| `02-naive-port.rs` | Pass 1. Compiles. Inline `// SMELL:` markers on antipatterns. |
| `03-optimized.rs` | Pass 2. Production-ready, fully commented at non-obvious sites. |
| `04-diff.md` | Structured diff. **Group sections by theme** (State model / Parallelism / Security / CPI & program reuse / Compute & rent / Idioms) — mirror the explanation log. Each section: short header, before/after snippets, `file:line` references to the two `.rs` files. |
| `05-explanation.md` | The explanation log. One entry per change in `04-diff.md`, grouped by theme. Schema below. |

When the optimized version meaningfully changes client-side integration (typically: SPL Token replaces a custom token surface, or balance/aggregate lookups move off the program), append a `## Frontend integration` section at the bottom of `05-explanation.md` containing: before/after TypeScript using `@solana/web3.js` + `@solana/spl-token`; the list of changed call sites a porting team will touch; migration scoping. If the integration shift is minor, fold it into a relevant entry's Tradeoff instead — don't bloat the file.

`05-explanation.md` is the teaching surface. Treat it as a first-class deliverable, not a comment block.

## Read first

Before producing any translation, internalize the EVM → SVM mental shift in `translation/mental-model.md`. The one-line summary: *on Ethereum the contract knows where its state lives; on Solana the caller brings it.* Every translation rule below is a consequence — if a step ever feels wrong, return to that file.

## Decision tree — which sub-files to load

Default-load: `translation/mental-model.md`, `translation/type-mapping.md`, `translation/pattern-mapping.md`, `security/arithmetic.md`, `security/account-validation.md`, `security/pda-canonicalization.md`.

The default loads are non-negotiable. The mental-model file frames every other decision; arithmetic, account validation, and PDA canonicalization are the three security classes that bite *every* ported contract.

| Source contains | Also load |
|---|---|
| ERC-20 / fungible token | `translation/stdlib-mapping.md`, `optimization/account-model.md`, `security/cpi-safety.md` |
| ERC-20 with `_update` / `_beforeTokenTransfer` override (fee-on-transfer, blacklist, paused-transfer, rebasing) | `translation/stdlib-mapping.md` (Token-2022 section); target Token-2022 with the matching extension (transfer fee, transfer hook, default account state, interest-bearing). Do **not** target classic SPL — the semantics cannot be expressed. |
| ERC-721 / ERC-1155 / NFT | `translation/stdlib-mapping.md`, `optimization/account-model.md`, `optimization/pdas.md` |
| `mapping(...)` storage | `optimization/account-model.md`, `optimization/pdas.md`, `optimization/parallelism.md` |
| Ownable / AccessControl / roles | `translation/stdlib-mapping.md`, `security/signer-checks.md` |
| Custom modifiers | `translation/pattern-mapping.md`, `security/signer-checks.md` |
| External calls / interfaces | `security/cpi-safety.md`, `security/reentrancy.md`, `optimization/program-splitting.md` |
| Heavy arithmetic / fixed-point | `security/arithmetic.md` (also default-loaded) |
| Hot-write global state (counters, `totalSupply`) | `optimization/parallelism.md`, `optimization/account-model.md` |
| Dynamic-sized state (arrays, mappings of unknown size) | `optimization/rent-and-size.md`, `optimization/account-model.md` |
| Multi-contract system | `optimization/program-splitting.md`, `security/cpi-safety.md` |
| Anything writing state after an external call | `security/reentrancy.md`, `security/cpi-safety.md` |
| Compute-pressured paths (multi-CPI swaps, loops in hot path, >300 expected CU per call) | `optimization/compute-budget.md` |
| Multiple account types owned by the program (type-confusion risk surface) | `security/account-validation.md` (also default-loaded) |
| Any PDA the program will sign for | `security/pda-canonicalization.md` (also default-loaded), `optimization/pdas.md` |
| Protocol takes a user-supplied token Mint as configuration (vault, AMM, lending market) | `security/reentrancy.md`, `security/account-validation.md`, `security/cpi-safety.md` |
| Vault/AMM/4626-shaped protocol (share/asset conversion math, deposit + withdraw + redeem semantics) | `security/arithmetic.md` (rounding-direction discipline), `optimization/account-model.md` (read aggregates from SPL Token), `optimization/parallelism.md` (read-only vault pattern) |
| Time-delta math (`now - last_update`, accumulator periods) | `security/arithmetic.md` (clock-skew + negative-delta-cast pitfall) |

Always load every security/* file relevant to the constructs present. Security is non-negotiable.

## Pre-flight checklist (gate on the optimized version)

Every item must hold before emitting `03-optimized.rs`. If one fails, fix and re-check.

- [ ] Every arithmetic op is `checked_*` — or has an inline justification for `saturating_*` / `wrapping_*`. No bare `+ - * /` on user-controlled values.
- [ ] Every `Account<'info, T>` either uses Anchor's typed checks or includes explicit owner + discriminator validation. No `AccountInfo` smuggled through without checks.
- [ ] Every signer-required path uses `Signer<'info>` or a manual `is_signer` check. No "the front end won't call it without a signer" reasoning.
- [ ] Every PDA derivation either uses `seeds = [...], bump = stored_bump` (preferred — saves ~1.5k CU per call) or bare `seeds = [...], bump,` (acceptable when CU is not pressured; both forms enforce canonicalization via Anchor's `find_program_address` check). The cached form is strongly preferred — all reference examples use it. Do **not** use `bump = <user_input>` — that's the actual canonicalization vulnerability.
- [ ] CPIs use `CpiContext::new` or `CpiContext::new_with_signer`. The program arg is a `Pubkey` (use `ctx.accounts.<program>.key()`) — Anchor 1.0+ removed the `AccountInfo` form. No hand-rolled `invoke`/`invoke_signed` with manually assembled `AccountInfo` arrays unless raw Solana is justified.
- [ ] No path mutates state after a CPI to an untrusted program without re-reading and re-validating. (See `security/reentrancy.md` for why account locking is necessary but not sufficient.)
- [ ] Account sizing is explicit: `space = 8 + <sum>`; the 8 is the Anchor discriminator. Variable-size fields have hard caps.
- [ ] Errors use `#[error_code]`. No `ProgramError::Custom(n)` literals, no `msg!`-then-fail.
- [ ] No PDA shares a write lock with high-frequency unrelated state. Per-entity PDAs over global counters where the protocol allows.
- [ ] If the contract emits events that SPL programs already emit (Transfer for SPL Token), prefer not duplicating them.
- [ ] Re-init protection: PDAs that should only init once use `init` (not `init_if_needed`) and have unique seeds.

## Tooling — Solana Developer MCP `rust_autofixer`

If your environment exposes the Solana Developer MCP (`https://mcp.solana.com/mcp`), the `rust_autofixer` tool is part of the workflow — not optional.

**When to call it:** every time you have produced or modified Anchor or Pinocchio Rust that you intend to ship. That includes `02-naive-port.rs` and `03-optimized.rs`, and any in-flight fix you apply after a failed `cargo check`.

**How to call it:** pass the full Rust source. Specify the framework (`auto`, `anchor`, or `pinocchio`) if the caller hasn't already.

**The loop:**

1. Call `rust_autofixer` on the current Rust.
2. Apply every suggested fix (they are mechanical, structured, and safe).
3. Call `rust_autofixer` again.
4. Repeat until `require_another_tool_call_after_fixing` is `false`.

Only emit the artifact once the loop terminates. This is in addition to — not a replacement for — the pre-flight checklist above; the autofixer catches the structural-safety class of bug, the checklist catches design/idiom issues.

**Do not use any other Solana MCP tool** (`list_sections`, `read_section`, `search`, etc.) for this workflow. Stay scoped to `rust_autofixer`.

## Explanation log schema

Each entry is exactly four fields. Keep them tight — one to four sentences each.

```
### <short title>

- **What:** the concrete change. Reference the diff section or `file:line` in the .rs files. This is the LOW-LEVEL view; cite specific identifiers, function names, line numbers.
- **Why:** the platform-level reasoning, structured as a two-sided contrast for a Solidity-fluent reader. Lead the first sentence(s) with **"On Ethereum, ..."** and describe the EVM/Solidity paradigm the developer is bringing with them. Then lead the next sentence(s) with **"On Solana, ..."** and describe the paradigm that diverges. Keep it HIGH-LEVEL — platform mechanics, mental model, what serializes / what doesn't, who owns what, what the runtime guarantees. Save the per-line / per-symbol detail for `What:`. Avoid backtick code fragments here unless absolutely necessary.
- **Benefit:** what is gained. Be specific: CU saved, parallelism unlocked, security class avoided, code deleted.
- **Tradeoff:** what is given up. If nothing meaningful, say so and justify briefly.
```

Group entries under thematic headers: `## State model`, `## Parallelism`, `## Security`, `## CPI & program reuse`, `## Compute & rent`, `## Idioms`.

## Explanation style — write for a Solidity-fluent reader who has never seen Solana

The reader knows Solidity well. They know financial systems. They have **not** internalized PDAs, the account model, SPL Token, rent, CPI, or Anchor's constraint vocabulary. The explanation log is where they bridge — every entry must land for that reader.

### Rules

1. **First-use translation, always inline.** The first time any Solana-specific term appears in a given explanation log, give a short EVM analog in parentheses or em-dashes. Don't assume a glossary; weave it into the prose. After first use, the term is fair game.

   Required glossing on first use (non-exhaustive):
   - **PDA** — "PDA (Program-Derived Address — a deterministic account address derived from seeds the program controls; analog of a Solidity storage slot keyed by `(address, mapping)` — but each PDA is its own account, not a slot inside the program)"
   - **SPL Token** — "SPL Token (the shared on-chain token program every fungible token reuses on Solana — instead of each ERC-20 deploying its own contract, every token is just configuration on this one program)"
   - **CPI** — "CPI (cross-program invocation — Solana's version of one contract `call`-ing another, but every account the callee will touch must already be in the caller's transaction)"
   - **rent** — "rent (a refundable SOL deposit every account pays to live on-chain; ~0.001 SOL per KB of account data, returned in full when the account is closed)"
   - **lamports** — "lamports (1 SOL = 1e9 lamports — Solana's gwei equivalent, but at 9 decimals instead of 18)"
   - **ATA / Associated Token Account** — "ATA (Associated Token Account — the canonical per-wallet token account for a given mint, with a deterministically derivable address; the analog of \"the wallet's balance for this token\")"
   - **Mint account** — "Mint account (the on-chain configuration for a token: total supply, decimals, who can mint — owned by the SPL Token program, not by the issuer)"
   - **Signer<'info>** — "Signer (an explicit `msg.sender` — Solana requires every signing account to be declared up front in the instruction's account list, vs. Solidity's implicit `msg.sender`)"
   - **Anchor** — "Anchor (the framework on top of raw Solana programs, similar to how Hardhat relates to raw EVM — provides macros, account validation, and the IDL)"
   - **init_if_needed** — "init_if_needed (an Anchor constraint that creates the account on first call and is a no-op on subsequent calls — Solana's closest analog to Solidity's implicit `mapping[key] = value`)"
   - **close = X** — "close = X (an Anchor constraint that tears the account down and refunds its rent to X when the instruction succeeds — there's no Solidity equivalent because Solidity storage slots can't be deleted)"
   - **discriminator** — "discriminator (an 8-byte type tag Anchor prepends to every account it manages, so deserializing a `Vault` account as a `Mint` fails loudly — no EVM analog because EVM has no typed account model)"
   - **has_one** — "has_one = authority (an Anchor constraint that verifies the account's stored `authority` field equals the `authority` account passed in the same instruction — the declarative form of `require(state.authority == signer)`)"
   - **seeds + bump** — "seeds (the byte inputs the program uses to derive a PDA; the `bump` is a nonce that makes the address valid). Conceptually: `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(...))` with extra steps to keep the result off the secp256k1 curve."
   - **write-lock / parallelism** — "Solana's runtime locks every writable account a transaction touches, so two transactions that mutate different accounts run in parallel — the EVM-style global single-threaded execution is replaced by per-account locks (Sealevel)."

2. **Comparative framing in Why bullets.** Prefer "In Solidity, you would have written X because Y. On Solana, the equivalent shape is Z because W" over "the PDA stores X". The reader anchors on what they already know.

3. **Plain-English code references.** When citing a Rust line by `file:line`, briefly say what it does in EVM-flavored language. Not just `f.contributors.iter_mut().find(|c| c.who == k)` — say "scans the contributor list linearly to find the supporter's row (the on-chain analog of `contributors[k]` in Solidity, but more expensive)."

4. **Spell out the consequence chain.** The reader doesn't yet know why "one PDA per supporter" matters. Don't say "no serialization of cross-supporter activity" without first explaining that Solana serializes writes to the *same account*, so isolating writes to different accounts is what unlocks parallelism. Two sentences > one tight one if the second sentence is doing teaching work.

5. **Tradeoff is honest.** Rent, extra accounts, Anchor-specific idioms a non-Anchor reader has to learn — name them concretely. The reader is evaluating a real migration; gloss only hurts.

### Side-by-side: bad → better

The current `examples/token-fundraiser/05-explanation.md` entry for §S1 reads:

> **Why:** Solidity's `mapping(address => uint256)` is one slot per supporter inside one contract — addressable by key inside one storage tree. The Solana equivalent is one account per supporter, addressable by PDA derivation. A `Vec` inside a state account is the wrong primitive: it bounds the supporter count, forces every contribute/refund to mutate the singleton state account, and scans linearly on lookup.

A Solidity-fluent reader who's never seen Solana parses "PDA derivation" as noise. Better — high-level, two clearly-marked sides:

> **Why:** On Ethereum, contract storage is global to the contract: every entry in a mapping lives in the same storage tree, and the contract is the single writer. On Solana, the equivalent of a mapping is *one on-chain account per entry* — each entry owns its own slice of state, with its own deterministic address, its own owner, and its own write-lock. The naive port collapses every entry back into one shared state account; that imitates the Solidity layout but loses the per-entry property that lets unrelated writes execute concurrently.

Same content, lower code density, lands for the reader. **Err on the side of teaching.** Length is not a virtue; clarity for the assumed reader is. Code-level identifiers belong in `What:` and in inline annotations on the .rs file — the `Why:` field is for the platform mental model. If a section already used the term, you don't need to re-explain it — the rule is "first use in this explanation log."

### Original example entry (for structure reference)

```
### Balances moved from on-chain map to SPL Token accounts

- **What:** Removed `balances: Vec<BalanceEntry>` from `TokenState` (`02-naive-port.rs:153`). Each holder now has an Associated Token Account (ATA — the canonical per-wallet token balance account, derived deterministically from `(wallet, mint)`); transfers go through `token::transfer` on the SPL Token program directly, not through this program (`03-optimized.rs` has no transfer instruction).
- **Why:** On Ethereum, an ERC-20 contract holds the balance ledger inside its own storage — every holder is a slot in the contract's `balanceOf` map, and every transfer is a contract call to that contract. On Solana, balances live in the network-wide SPL Token program rather than inside any individual program — each holder has their own on-chain account, and transfers move balances directly between those accounts without going through the issuing program at all. Keeping a custom map would re-implement that shared infrastructure inside the program and force every transfer to write-lock the program's state.
- **Benefit:** Transfers between disjoint sender/recipient pairs run in parallel (Solana's runtime locks accounts, not the program — so writes to Alice→Bob and Carol→Dan don't block each other). ~150 lines of custom balance/allowance logic deleted. No path for a buggy custom balance update.
- **Tradeoff:** Holders create an ATA before first receipt — a one-time ~0.002 SOL rent deposit (refundable when the account is closed). Off-chain code computes ATA addresses to read balances instead of reading one contract account.
```

## Reference example

Trace the protocol on `examples/token-fundraiser/` end-to-end before producing translations of new inputs. The example exists so you can verify the protocol produces the contract.

## Ambiguities

See `DECISIONS.md` at the skill root for choices made during construction (Anchor version, SPL Token classic vs Token-2022, etc.). When in doubt on a new translation, prefer the choice consistent with the reference example unless the input forces otherwise.
